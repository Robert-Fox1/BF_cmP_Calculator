#### **About this BF and cmP Calculator**
This calculator estimates the *Bayes Factor* (*BF*) and *Approximate Correct Model Probability* (*cmP*) values by using the *Bayesian Information Criteria* (*BIC*) [1,2] values (which can be obtained by common statistical software, such as Mplus). These values can be useful in determining the appropriate number of latent classes in finite mixture models, such as latent class analysis and latent profile analysis. For an overview and description of these statistics see [2].

This calculator can be used as a quick means to estimate the *BF* and *cmP* values, which are not readily available in all structural equation modelling (SEM) software.

#### **Bayes Factor** 
The *BF* can be used to make a pairwise comparison of relative fit between two adjacent models (*Model K* and *Model K + 1*, where *K* is the number of latent classes). 

* A BF less than 3 is generally considered as weak evidence in support of *Model K* over *Model K + 1*.  
* A BF greater than or equal to 3 and less than 10 is generally considered as moderate evidence in support of *Model K* over *Model K + 1*.  
* A BF greater than or equal to 10 is generally considered as strong evidence in support of *Model K* over *Model K + 1*.

#### **Approximate Correct Model Probability**
The *cmP* estimates the probability of each model being the "correct" model, relative to all models tested, assuming that the "true" model is among those examined [2]. Based on the cmP, the model with the highest value is selected.
